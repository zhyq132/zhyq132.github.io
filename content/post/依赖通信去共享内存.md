[原文：Share Memory By Communicating](https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating)

Traditional threading models (commonly used when writing Java, C++, and Python programs, for example) require the programmer to communicate between threads using shared memory. Typically, shared data structures are protected by locks, and threads will contend over those locks to access the data. In some cases, this is made easier by the use of thread-safe data structures such as Python's Queue.

- 传统的线程模型（例如，通常用java c++ python编写的程序）需要程序员在线程之间通信才能使用共享内存。典型的，共享数据结构被lock保护，线程将竞争这些lock来获取访问数据的机会。在一些情况下，通过使用线程安全的数据结构会更简单，例如python的队列。

Go's concurrency primitives - goroutines and channels - provide an elegant and distinct means of structuring concurrent software. (These concepts have an interesting history that begins with C. A. R. Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes.) Instead of explicitly using locks to mediate access to shared data, Go encourages the use of channels to pass references to data between goroutines. This approach ensures that only one goroutine has access to the data at a given time. The concept is summarized in the document Effective Go (a must-read for any Go programmer):
Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

- Go的并发基础：goroutine、channel，提供了一个优雅的、显而易见的方法来结构化并发软件。（这些概念有一个有趣的历史,其兴起自C. A. R. Hoare作者的Communicating Sequential Processes一书）。替代“明确的使用锁”来限制共享数据的访问，Go鼓励在goroutine之间使用channel传递数据的引用，这种方式确保了在同一时间只有一个goroutine可以访问共享数据。这个概念有个大致的总结，在官方的Effective Go文档里。（Go程序员必读文档）：不要用共享内存通信，用通信去共享内存。

Consider a program that polls a list of URLs. In a traditional threading environment, one might structure its data like so:

- 考虑一个程序：轮流查询一列URL。在传统线程环境下，初始化其数据如下
```
type Resource struct {
    url        string
    polling    bool
    lastPolled int64
}

type Resources struct {
    data []*Resource
    lock *sync.Mutex
}
```
And then a Poller function (many of which would run in separate threads) might look something like this:

- 一个轮训的方法（这些方法中的大多数，将会在单独的线程中运行）应该是看起来像这样的：

```
func Poller(res *Resources) {
    for {
        // get the least recently-polled Resource
        // and mark it as being polled
        res.lock.Lock()
        var r *Resource
        for _, v := range res.data {
            if v.polling {
                continue
            }
            if r == nil || v.lastPolled < r.lastPolled {
                r = v
            }
        }
        if r != nil {
            r.polling = true
        }
        res.lock.Unlock()
        if r == nil {
            continue
        }

        // poll the URL

        // update the Resources polling and lastPolled
        res.lock.Lock()
        r.polling = false
        r.lastPolled = time.Nanoseconds()
        res.lock.Unlock()
    }
}
```
This function is about a page long, and requires more detail to make it complete. It doesn't even include the URL polling logic (which, itself, would only be a few lines), nor will it gracefully handle exhausting the pool of Resources.

- 这个方式看起来有一夜那么长，需要更多的详情才能完成，甚至这还不包括URL轮训的逻辑（这也是要不少行代码），也不会优雅的处理耗尽资源的资源

Let's take a look at the same functionality implemented using Go idiom. In this example, Poller is a function that receives Resources to be polled from an input channel, and sends them to an output channel when they're done.

- 让我们看看同样的用Go方法来实现。这个例子中，Poller是个从输入channel中接受资源去轮训的方法，然后当其完成后就发送数据给输出channel

```
type Resource string

func Poller(in, out chan *Resource) {
    for r := range in {
        // poll the URL

        // send the processed Resource to out
        out <- r
    }
}
```
